                SCUBA CERTIFICATION COURSE</p>
                <p>Your scuba certification adventure begins with on-line academics where you learn the fundamentals of scuba equipment and the safe rules of scuba diving in your own home and at your own pace.  Upon completion of your online academics we set a class schedule review in our store to review the fundamentals of safe diving practices, including how to assemble your gear.  Upon completion of classroom review it’s off to the local dive park – confined water – where you develop a comfortable training level of scuba skills.   Upon completion of confined water we schedule your Open Water dives.</p>
